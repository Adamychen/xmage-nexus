# Project Roadmap: XMage Nexus

> **A Modern, Web-Based Digital Card Game Client for XMage**  
> *Last updated: 2026-08-21*

---

## 1. Vision & Architectural Philosophy

The goal of **XMage Nexus** is to deliver a fast, modern, and beautiful web client with an **Arena-grade aesthetic** (WebGL2 rendering, animated targeting, sound, smooth interaction) while leveraging the battle-tested, 10-year **XMage Java server** (`Mage.Server`) as the authoritative rules engine, card database (+25,000 cards), and multiplayer matchmaking backend.

### The 3-Tier Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────┐          WebSocket JSON          ┌──────────────────────────┐      JBoss / TCP      ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  XMage Nexus Web Client │ ◄──────────────────────────────► │        Mage.Proxy        │ ◄───────────────────► │      XMage Server       │
│  (React 19 + PixiJS)    │   (Type-safe protocol schema)    │  (Java 17 / MageClient)  │   (Native protocol)   │  (1.4.61-V1 / Official) │
└─────────────────────────┘                                  └──────────────────────────┘                       └─────────────────────────┘
```

- **Zero Rules Re-implementation**: XMage handles all legality, priority checks, layers, triggers, timers, and state-based actions.
- **Clean Decoupling**: The Java proxy acts as a legitimate `MageClient`, translating JBoss serialization into clean, reflection-safe JSON.
- **Asynchronous State Machine**: The web client uses non-blocking reactive stores, monotonic state tracking, and floating UI dialogs to bridge XMage's synchronous Swing origins into modern web paradigms.

## 2. Current State Assessment (Verified & Completed)

The project has successfully conquered the most difficult engineering hurdles (protocol bridging, async feedback loops, mana payments, targeting):

| Milestone | Scope | Status | Verification & Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0: Proxy Bridge** | Java 17 proxy (`Mage.Proxy`), WebSocket gateway, cycle-safe JSON serializer. | ✅ **Completed** | Connect + real game flow works against `beta.xmage.today:17171` AND local `localhost:17171` (same 1.4.61-V1 fork). NOTE: beta's anonymous-login handshake is intermittently fatal server-side (`Can't receive server state before other data`) and is **not** fixed by any proxy buffer — beta is best-effort only; CI's real-protocol oracle is the local server. The proxy is now **multi-tenant** (one process serves many independent users), which already enables zero-install server-side play today (see `AGENTS.md`). |
| **Phase 1: Web Foundation** | React 19 + TS + Vite + PixiJS 8. Lobby, room chat, real-time tables/users, Scryfall HD card cache (IndexedDB), full 1v1 board rendering & spectator mode. | ✅ **Completed** | 100% typecheck clean, live AI vs AI spectator matches working end-to-end. |
| **Phase 2: Interaction Engine** | London mulligan, priority loops (`GAME_SELECT`), visual targeting (animated dotted lines & pulsing glows), mana tapping & pool payment (`sendPlayerManaType`), floating non-blocking combat UI (attack/block & alpha strike), advanced spell interactions (X-costs, multi-target, modal choices, +1/+1 counters). | ✅ **Completed** | Validated via `human-test.mjs` (83 checks PASS) and Playwright E2E suites (*Blaze*, *Arc Trail*, *Boros Charm*, *Walking Ballista*). |
| **Quality & QA Foundation** | 105 unit tests (vitest, <1s), Java→TS JSON Schema codegen (`gen-types.mjs`), dual-mode Playwright E2E (deterministic FakeServer + Real XMage Stack with `SimPlayer` bots). | ✅ **Completed** | Zero-flake local iteration loop + continuous anti-drift contract testing (3 guards: `callbackCoverage`, `mechanicsCoverage` server→client, `engineViewCoverage` engine→view). |

## 6. Execution Guidelines

1. **Protocol-First Rule**: Never mutate client state optimistically without an authoritative server update. Player actions are intents sent to the proxy; the resulting `GameView` dictates the UI state.
2. **Schema Invariant**: Whenever proxy Java event models change, execute `node scripts/gen-types.mjs --validate` to keep TypeScript contract definitions strictly in sync.
3. **Dual-Testing Requirement**:
   - Fast UI/logic changes must pass `npm run test` (vitest) and `npm run test:e2e:fake` (Playwright against FixtureServer).
   - Core protocol/interaction changes must pass `node scripts/test.mjs` against the live stack with `SimPlayer` bots.
4. **Zero Flake Policy**: Avoid canvas byte-diff comparisons in E2E tests. Assert against deterministic scene state exposed on `window.__mageScene`.

---

## 7. Standardized Card Component Architecture

### 1. Special Card Morphology (MDFCs, Transform, Adventures, Sagas)

In modern card games, many cards are not static single-faced rectangles:

• Double-Faced Cards (MDFCs / Transform / Battles): e.g. Delver of Secrets, Valakut Awakening, Invasion of Zendikar.
• Adventures and Split Cards: e.g. Brazen Borrower // Petty Theft, Fire // Ice.
• Sagas and Classes: Have chapters (I, II, III) or levels that progress with counters.
• Tokens: Creatures, Treasures, Food, Clues, Maps, Blood.

```
  ┌──────────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────────┐
  │ [Delver of Secrets]  (U) │           │ [Insectile Aberration]   │
  │ 1/1 Creature - Wizard    │  ──(⟲)──▶ │ 3/2 Creature - Insect    │
  │ At the beginning of...   │   Flip    │ Flying                   │
  │                    [ ⟲ ] │           │                    [ ⟲ ] │
  └──────────────────────────┘           └──────────────────────────┘
```

#### How it is standardized (MultiFaceCard Pattern):
• In data: XMage already exposes `secondCardFace`, `isTransformed`, `isToken`, and `counters.LORE` in `CardView`.
• In UI:
  1. A floating flip button ⟲ (or keyboard shortcut / hover) on the card corner to preview the back face in hand and graveyard.
  2. On the battlefield, if `isTransformed === true`, automatically render the face-B texture (Scryfall indexes this as `card_faces[1]`).
  3. For Sagas and Classes, a badge on the card showing the current chapter (`ChapterBadge: [II]`).

──────
### 2. Attachment Hierarchy (Auras, Equipment, Mutate)

When playing an Aura or Equipment, they attach to a creature. In Mutate mechanics, multiple cards stack under/over the host creature.

```
  ┌──────────────────────────────┐
  │  ┌───────────────────────┐   │  (Equipment)
  │  │ ┌───────────────────┐ │   │
  │  │ │                   │ │   │
  │  │ │ Host Creature (5/6)│ │  │
  │  │ │                   │ │   │
  │  │ └───────────────────┘ │   │
  │  └───────────────────────┘   │
  └──────────────────────────────┘
```

#### How it is standardized (AttachmentAnchor Pattern):
• In data: XMage sends `attachedTo: UUID` or `attachments: UUID[]` on each permanent.
• In UI:
  1. Rather than occupying independent slots on the battlefield, attachments render cascaded behind the host creature (offset 10px up/right).
  2. If the host creature taps or attacks, all its attachments move along with it as a single unit.

──────
### 3. Global State Indicators and Player Counters

In addition to life and mana, the game engine tracks persistent global states and counters:

• Player counters: Poison (Poison ≥ 10 = defeat), Energy, Experience, Radiation (Rad counters).
• Global designation states:
  • The Monarch (👑).
  • The Initiative / Dungeons (🏰).
  • Day / Night (☀️ / 🌙).
  • City's Blessing.
• Planeswalker Emblems: Permanent passive abilities.

#### How it is standardized (PlayerBadgeStrip & EmblemTray Pattern):
• In data: `PlayerView` includes `counters.POISON`, `isMonarch`, `hasCitysBlessing`, and `GameView.emblems`.
• In UI: A compact pill bar beside player life:
  `[ 💖 20 ] [ 💀 3 ] [ ⚡ 4 ] [ 👑 Monarch ] [ ☀️ Day ]`
  Hovering over an emblem opens the enlarged card preview.

──────
### 4. Keyword Ability Badges

In a match with many creatures on the board, reading card text to check for Flying, Deathtouch, or Trample creates cognitive load.

```
  ┌────────────────────────┐
  │  Questing Beast   4/4  │
  │                        │
  │   [🪽] [⚡] [☠️] [🛡️]  │  ◄── Visual badges on the frame
  └────────────────────────┘
```

#### How it is standardized (KeywordBadgeSet Pattern):
• In data: `CardView.rules` and `CardView.abilities` contain parsed keywords.
• In UI: A set of micro SVG icons on the lower-left corner of the permanent:
  • 🪽 Flying / Reach
  • ⚡ Haste / First Strike
  • ☠️ Deathtouch
  • 🦏 Trample
  • 🛡️ Vigilance / Hexproof / Ward
  • 💖 Lifelink

──────
### 5. Revealed Information / Known Cards (Known Information Tray)

When an effect reveals an opponent's hand, those cards remain public knowledge until played or discarded.

```
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Opponent's Hand:   [ 🂠 ] [ 🂠 ] [ 🂠 ]                 │  (3 hidden cards)
  │  Known Cards:       [ Bolt ] [ Push ]                  │  (Previously revealed)
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### How it is standardized (KnownHandTracker Pattern):
• In data: XMage tracks shown cards in `PlayerView.revealedHand`.
• In UI: A miniature tray directly above the opponent's hidden hand displaying verified known cards face up.

──────
### Summary of Component Architecture

| Standard Component | Solves | Implementation Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| `MultiFaceCard` | MDFCs, Transform, Werewolves, Sagas, Adventures | 🟢 Low (Flip button + alternate texture) |
| `AttachmentAnchor` | Auras, Equipment, and Mutate grouped visually | 🟢 Low (CSS / relative offsets) |
| `PlayerBadgeStrip` | Poison, Energy, Monarch, Day/Night, Emblems | 🟢 Low (Status icon badges) |
| `KeywordBadges` | Flying, Deathtouch, Trample, Haste, etc. | 🟢 Low (SVG icons on card sprite) |
| `KnownHandTracker` | Revealed cards after discard / look effects | 🟢 Low (Mini-tray of known cards) |

All of these connect directly to fields already sent by `GameView` from Java without requiring server changes.
