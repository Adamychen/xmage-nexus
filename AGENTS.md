# AGENTS.md — XMage Nexus

A modern, high-performance web client for XMage. The stack consists of:
XMage server (Java, test mode) + WebSocket proxy (`Mage.Proxy`, Java) + web
client (`web`, React 19 + TypeScript + PixiJS 8 + Vite).

**Master document: `PROJECT.md`** — source of truth for status, phases and
lessons. Update it when finishing a task (phases, lessons, quality table,
dated log) and record the date in the header. Also keep the interaction
coverage matrix `web/INTERACTION_COVERAGE.md` in sync (mark implemented/tested
+ test ref + date per callback/interaction); the guard `callbackCoverage.test.ts`
enforces that every server callback has a handler or is listed as planned.

**Contributor docs:**

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — developer workflow, file map, how to add events/types/features, testing guide

## Development stack

- Control: `node scripts/ctl.mjs start|stop|restart|status [server|proxy|vite|all]`
- Direct diagnostics (blocks the shell): `node scripts/dev.mjs start|stop|status|restart`
- Logs: `node scripts/tail.mjs [server|proxy|vite|all] [lines]` — files in `.run/*.log`
  (`server.out.log`, `proxy.out.log`, `proxy.err.log`, `vite.out.log`)
- Ports: XMage server `17171` (testMode), proxy WS `ws://127.0.0.1:8787`,
  proxy test page `http://127.0.0.1:8788/index.html`, Vite dev `http://localhost:5173`
- Rebuild the proxy jar: `node scripts/build.mjs proxy` (requires stopping
  the proxy; `build.mjs` stops it on its own) — afterwards `node scripts/ctl.mjs restart proxy`
- Full build (server + plugins + proxy): `node scripts/build.mjs`
- XMage version: **1.4.61-V1** (upstream magefree/mage; merge of tag `xmage_1.4.61V1`).
  Proxy jar: `Mage.Proxy/target/mage-proxy-1.4.61.jar`. The proxy's default
  server is **`beta.xmage.today:17171`** (current official server; `beta.xmage.de` is obsolete).
  If the remote server changes release (strict version check `MAGE_VERSION_RELEASE_INFO_MUST_BE_SAME`),
  the proxy won't connect: the fork must be updated (fetch upstream + merge) and everything rebuilt.
- Smoke test against the public server: works via the proxy (WS probe: login, SIM table, WATCHGAME/GAME_INIT/updates).
  Notes: (a) **anonymous login to `beta.xmage.today` is intermittent and NOT fixed in-repo** —
  the fatal `Can't receive server state before other data` / `connectStart=false` originates in the
  *remote* XMage server's handshake (server-side; the proxy has **no** handshake buffer — the
  `2026-08-17` "RESOLVED" note in `ROADMAP.md` is inaccurate). Treat beta as best-effort only.
  (b) the web login uses a SINGLE host for both the proxy WS and the target server → to play
  against remote servers from the browser those fields must be split (pending, Phase 3).

### Real-protocol validation harness (anti-drift)
The goal is a client that works against `beta.xmage.today`, but beta is flaky. So the **oracle for
"real protocol" in CI is the local XMage server** (`node scripts/ctl.mjs restart all` →
`localhost:17171`, same 1.4.61-V1 fork). The recorder captures real frames and the fake-mode tests
replay them, giving drift detection without depending on beta:

- `scripts/rec-lib.mjs` + `scripts/record.mjs <mechanic|all>` — a single WS recorder that drives a
  real game (HUMAN+SIM, `skipInitShuffling`) and dumps the first `GAME_UPDATE` matching a driver's
  `captureWhen` predicate to `web/fixtures/recorded/<mechanic>.json`
  (`{recordedAt, gameId, gameView}`). Add a mechanic by registering a driver in `record.mjs`
  (deck + `onSelect` script + `captureWhen`); the boilerplate (connect, table, mulligan, mana via
  `sendPlayerUUID` of an untapped source, capture) is shared.
- `web/fixtures/recorded/manifest.json` — lists each frame + its invariant (`hasMutatedPermanent`,
  `hasNonMutatedCreature`, …).
- `web/fixtures/recorded.test.ts` — vitest that validates every frame's `gameView` against the
  contract schema (`gameViewFromAndValidate`) and asserts its invariant. Runs with no Java/stack.
- `web/fixtures/scenarios/replay-recorded.ts` + `web/e2e/recorded.spec.ts` — replays each recorded
  frame in the `FakeServer` and asserts the web renders it (no `pageErrors`, board paints,
  mechanic-specific DOM). Run with `npx playwright test recorded.spec.ts`.

Workflow: after changing the proxy/web, regenerate golden frames with `record.mjs all` against the
local server, commit `web/fixtures/recorded/*.json`, and let CI validate + replay them.


## Working model & isolation

This repo has three independent concerns, each developable on its own:

- **`web/`** — React/Vite/TS client. **No Java, no fork, no proxy needed.**
  Runs against the bundled `FakeServer` for all `unit`/`typecheck`/`build`/
  `e2e-fake`. Scoped doc: `web/AGENTS.md`.
- **`Mage.Proxy/`** — Java WebSocket bridge. Needs the XMage fork built into
  `~/.m2` (once per XMage release); develop standalone after that. Scoped doc:
  `Mage.Proxy/AGENTS.md`.
- **XMage fork (`Mage.*`)** — the rules engine. Large; only rebuilt when the
  XMage version changes or the test-mode patches need adjusting.

Real-mode E2E (against a live proxy + server) reuses a prebuilt
`mage-proxy-*.jar` (`build.mjs proxy` once); web developers never run Maven.

## Test suite

Orchestrator: `node scripts/test.mjs [layer...] [--skip=unit,e2e]` — layers:

`unit` (vitest) · `coverage` (vitest --coverage) · `typecheck` (tsc -b --noEmit) ·
`build` (tsc -b && vite build) · `java` (mvn -pl Mage.Proxy -am test) ·
`self-test` (headless E2E against the proxy; requires stack) ·
`human-test` (E2E human player vs AI; requires stack) ·
`e2e` (playwright in web; requires vite)

Success criteria and details in the `mage-test-suite` skill.

## E2E with dual backends: deterministic fake and real

Browser E2E (Playwright) runs in **two modes with the SAME specs**:

- **fake (default, `npm run test:e2e` / `test:e2e:fake`)**: against the
   `FixtureServer` (`web/fixtures/fake.ts`, contract from
   `src/net/types.ts` + declarative scenarios in `fixtures/scenarios/`). No
   Java, no proxy, no flakes — the daily iteration loop. Uses dedicated port
   **8789** (independent of the proxy ports: WS 8787 and HTTP page 8788). `playwright.config.ts` starts
   vite only in fake mode.
- **real (`E2E_BACKEND=real npm run test:e2e:real`)**: against the stack
   (server+proxy+vite). This is the anti-drift net: if the real protocol moves,
   this mode detects it. Runs in CI/nightly and on demand.

The FakeServer is typed against `types.ts` (typecheck guards consistency) and
the frames it emits are validated with `fixtures/schema.ts` (zod) — if the real
proxy adds/changes fields, the schema test fails and is regenerated with the recorder.

**Deterministic UI assertions**: `BoardScene` publishes `window.__mageScene`
(cards, playable, targeting{active,source,ids,chosen}, game). Tests assert
against that state (and the DOM), NOT against canvas pixels (byte-diffs were
the source of flakes).

**Known bugs in the real stack (2026-08-16, detected by real mode)**:
1. **The AI-vs-AI demo NO LONGER FREEZES (RESOLVED)**: `SimPlayer.tryCast` was sending
   the Bolt UUID even when its untapped lands were ISLANDs; the server correctly
   rejected the cast (`canPay` doesn't cover {R}) and the game re-granted
   priority with the same view → infinite GAME_SELECT (flood ~48/s to the watcher).
   **Fix**: `tryCast` is now color-aware (`colorsOf` + `canProduceColors`, only
   casts if there are lands that produce ALL the colors of the cost) + dedup by
   signature `(turn, step, hand, untapped lands)` as defense. Verified in real
   ×6+ (the demo casts and resolves Bolts).
2. **`spells.spec.ts` and `targeting.spec.ts` in real mode: GREEN** (2026-08-16).
    The cause of their failures ("Sim win after the mana ask") was the
    **degraded server state caused by orphan sessions** — restarting
    server+proxy TOGETHER fixes it (`ctl.mjs restart all`); restarting ONLY the
   proxy leaves the first login hanging. Combined with test fixes (`nextManaSource`
    retry, strict cursor in the mana loop).
3. **The fake-mode demo (`fixtures/scenarios/fullFlow.ts`) suffers neither the
    freeze nor the flood**: the timeline is deterministic.
4. **Port conflict resolved (2026-08-20)**: fake mode now uses port **8789** (dedicated; the earlier 8788 collided with the proxy's HTTP test page),
   real proxy stays on **8787**. No more stop/start race conditions — both modes
   can run simultaneously.

## E2E with simulated opponents (Sim) and WS helper

UI E2E uses `SIM` seats (the proxy joins a deterministic bot with its own
session) and a `HumanHelper` over WS (`web/e2e/wshelper.ts`) that
plays lands, passes priorities, discards and answers asks — fragile actions go
over WS and the UI only verifies (dialogs, render, pageerrors). Tests do NOT
enable the web's auto-pass (it competes with the launch windows). Load `mage-e2e-sim`
before touching or debugging any E2E.

**Modular architecture (2026-08-17)**: tests by functionality, independent
game per test. Common libraries in `web/e2e/support/`
(`frames.ts`, `start-game.ts`, `game-screen.ts`, `scene.ts`, `canvas.ts`,
`fake-backend.ts`) and declarative scenarios for the FixtureServer in
`web/fixtures/scenarios/` (mini-engine `humanGame.ts`). Tags by
domain: `@spells`, `@targeting`, `@combat`, `@fullflow` (scripts
`test:e2e:spells|targeting|combat|fullflow`). All specs run in fake
(no stack, ~56s) and in real (contract). When touching `e2e/support/` or the
scenarios, run the full fake + real suite. **The helper does NOT answer the
mulligan** (the web's auto-keep already does it; a second false breaks the
test window).

## Rules

- **After touching `web`**: run `unit` and `typecheck` (and `build` if
  the build changed). After touching proxy Java: `java` + rebuild jar
  (`build.mjs proxy`) + restart proxy.
- **Before declaring a task "done"**: full suite
  (`node scripts/test.mjs`) with the stack up.
- **Known failure**: `self-test` may fail in `WATCHGAME` only on the first
  game after a cold server start (the server loses the callback
  return socket: `SESSION CALLBACK EXCEPTION - Unable to create socket`
  in `server.out.log`). Retry once with a warm server; if it fails
  repeatedly, it's a real bug, not a flake.
- **Do not touch** generated files: `dist/`, `.run/`, `local-server/`,
  `node_modules/`, `target/`.
- No comments in code unless requested.
- Do not commit unless explicitly requested.
